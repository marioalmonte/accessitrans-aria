Translate ARIA attributes in Elementor using WPML, improving the accessibility of your multilingual website.

== Description ==

The AccessiTrans - ARIA Translator for WPML & Elementor plugin facilitates the translation of ARIA attributes in sites developed with Elementor and WPML, ensuring that accessibility information is available in all languages of your website.

= Key Features =

* Automatically detects and makes ARIA attributes available for translation
* Fully integrated with WPML String Translation
* Compatible with all Elementor elements and templates
* Multiple capture methods to ensure comprehensive detection
* Translation retry mechanism for failed translations
* Force refresh function to clear all caches
* Debug mode for troubleshooting
* Performance optimization settings
* Translation cache system for improved performance
* Internationalization support

= Compatible ARIA attributes =

The plugin allows you to translate the following attributes:

* `aria-label`: To provide an accessible name for an element
* `aria-description`: To provide an accessible description
* `aria-roledescription`: To customize the role description of an element
* `aria-placeholder`: For placeholder text in input fields
* `aria-valuetext`: To provide textual representation of numeric values

= Capture Methods =

The plugin offers several capture methods to ensure that all ARIA attributes are detected:

1. **Full HTML Capture**: Captures all HTML of the page (highly effective but may affect performance)
2. **Elementor Content Filter**: Processes content generated by Elementor
3. **Elementor Template Processing**: Processes Elementor template data
4. **Individual Element Processing**: Processes each Elementor widget individually

= Advanced Settings =

* **Retry Failed Translations**: Automatically retries translations that failed on first attempt
* **Debug Mode**: Enables detailed event logging
* **Admin-Only Capture**: Limits resource-intensive capture methods to admin users
* **Capture in Primary Language Only**: Only captures strings when browsing in the default language

= Compatibility =

Works with all types of Elementor content:

* Regular pages
* Templates
* Global sections
* Headers and footers
* Popups and other dynamic elements

**Tested with:**
* WordPress 6.8
* Elementor 3.28.4
* WPML Multilingual CMS 4.7.4
* WPML String Translation 3.3.3

= Why this plugin matters for accessibility =

In multilingual websites, accessibility information should be available in all languages. ARIA attributes provide essential accessibility information that helps assistive technologies understand and navigate your website. By making these attributes translatable, you ensure that all users, regardless of language or ability, can access your content effectively.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin via the WordPress.org plugin repository, or upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/accessitrans-aria/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings → AccessiTrans to configure the plugin options
4. Configure ARIA attributes in Elementor (see usage instructions)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with other page builders besides Elementor? =

No, currently the plugin is specifically designed to work with Elementor.

= Is it compatible with the latest version of WPML? =

Yes, the plugin has been tested with version 4.7.4 of WPML Multilingual CMS and 3.3.3 of WPML String Translation.

= Why do I see duplicate entries in WPML String Translation? =

The plugin registers strings using different formats to ensure maximum compatibility with all types of Elementor content. You only need to translate each unique text once.

= Will this plugin slow down my website? =

The plugin includes several performance optimization options. By default, the most resource-intensive capture method (Full HTML Capture) only runs for admin users. You can adjust these settings in the plugin's configuration page.

= Can I use this plugin with Elementor Free? =

Yes, the plugin works with both Elementor Free and Elementor Pro.

= What should I do if translations aren't working correctly? =

Try using the "Force Refresh" button in the plugin settings. This will clear all caches and reinitialize the translation system.

= Do I need to keep all capture methods enabled? =

No. It's recommended to enable all methods during the initial setup to capture all ARIA attributes. After that, you can disable them to improve performance and only re-enable when adding new ARIA attributes to your site.

= How do I know if the ARIA attributes are being translated correctly? =

You can verify this by:
1. Adding ARIA attributes in Elementor
2. Translating them in WPML String Translation
3. Switching to a different language on your frontend
4. Inspecting the element with browser developer tools to see if the translated text appears

= Does this work with Elementor global widgets and templates? =

Yes, the plugin works with all types of Elementor content, including global widgets, templates, and dynamic elements.

== Screenshots ==

1. Configuration interface showing different capture methods and settings
2. Elementor's Advanced tab showing where to add custom ARIA attributes
3. Code transformation process showing how ARIA attributes are processed
4. WPML String Translation interface displaying ARIA attributes ready for translation
5. Diagnostic tools interface for troubleshooting translations
6. Settings interface with activation options for capturing methods

== Usage Instructions ==

= How to add ARIA attributes in Elementor =

1. Edit any element in Elementor
2. Go to the "Advanced" tab
3. Find the "Custom Attributes" section
4. Add the ARIA attributes you want to translate

= Compatible formats =

Elementor indicates: "Set custom attributes for the wrapper element. Each attribute in a separate line. Separate attribute key from the value using `|` character."

You can add ARIA attributes in two ways:

**Basic format (one attribute per line):**
```
aria-label|Text to translate
```

**Multiline format (multiple attributes):**
```
aria-label|Text to translate
aria-description|Another description
```

This will generate the corresponding HTML attributes in the frontend:
`aria-label="Text to translate" aria-description="Another description"`

= How to translate the attributes =

1. Once you've added the attributes, save the page or template
2. Go to WPML → String Translation
3. Filter by the "AccessiTrans ARIA Attributes" context
4. Translate the strings as you would with any other text in WPML

= Best practices for optimal performance =

For the best experience and website performance, follow these recommendations:

1. **Browse your site in the primary language only** while generating strings for translation. This prevents registering duplicate strings.

2. **Use the Force Refresh function** when translations aren't appearing as expected.

3. **Disable capture methods after initial setup**:
   * Once you've captured all ARIA attributes for translation, we recommend disabling all capture methods
   * This improves site performance and prevents additional strings from being registered in WPML
   * Re-enable the capture methods temporarily when you make changes to your site that include new ARIA attributes

= Practical examples =

**For a menu button:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Open menu`

**For a phone link:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Call customer service phone`

**For an icon without text:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Send an email`

**For a slider:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Image gallery`
* Attribute: `aria-description|Navigate through product images`
