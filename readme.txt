Translate ARIA attributes in Elementor using WPML, improving the accessibility of your multilingual website.

== Description ==

The AccessiTrans - ARIA Translator for WPML & Elementor plugin facilitates the translation of ARIA attributes in sites developed with Elementor and WPML, ensuring that accessibility information is available in all languages of your website.

= Key Features =

* Automatically detects and makes ARIA attributes available for translation
* Fully integrated with WPML String Translation
* Compatible with all Elementor elements and templates
* Multiple capture methods to ensure comprehensive detection
* Configurable translation registration formats
* Translation retry mechanism for failed translations
* Force refresh function to clear all caches
* Configurable translation priority
* Debug mode for troubleshooting
* Performance optimization settings
* Internationalization support

= Compatible ARIA attributes =

The plugin allows you to translate the following attributes:

* `aria-label`: To provide an accessible name for an element
* `aria-description`: To provide an accessible description
* `aria-roledescription`: To customize the role description of an element
* `aria-placeholder`: For placeholder text in input fields
* `aria-valuetext`: To provide textual representation of numeric values

= Capture Methods =

The plugin offers several capture methods to ensure that all ARIA attributes are detected:

1. **Full HTML Capture**: Captures all HTML of the page (highly effective but may affect performance)
2. **Elementor Content Filter**: Processes content generated by Elementor
3. **Elementor Template Processing**: Processes Elementor template data
4. **Individual Element Processing**: Processes each Elementor widget individually

= Translation Registration Formats =

The plugin supports multiple formats for registering strings for translation:

1. **Direct Format**: Registers the literal value as the name
2. **Prefix Format**: Registers with the format `aria-attribute_value`
3. **Element ID Format**: Registers with a format that includes the element ID

**Important:** It is recommended to enable all three formats for maximum robustness.

= Advanced Settings =

* **Retry Failed Translations**: Automatically retries translations that failed on first attempt
* **Translation Priority**: Configure the priority of translation filters
* **Debug Mode**: Enables detailed event logging
* **Admin-Only Capture**: Limits resource-intensive capture methods to admin users

= Compatibility =

Works with all types of Elementor content:

* Regular pages
* Templates
* Global sections
* Headers and footers
* Popups and other dynamic elements

**Tested with:**
* WordPress 6.8
* Elementor 3.28.3
* WPML Multilingual CMS 4.7.3
* WPML String Translation 3.3.2

= Why this plugin matters for accessibility =

In multilingual websites, accessibility information should be available in all languages. ARIA attributes provide essential accessibility information that helps assistive technologies understand and navigate your website. By making these attributes translatable, you ensure that all users, regardless of language or ability, can access your content effectively.

== Installation ==

1. Download the `accessitrans-aria.zip` file from the GitHub releases page
2. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/accessitrans-aria/` directory of your WordPress installation or install directly through WordPress by uploading the ZIP file
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to Settings → AccessiTrans to configure the plugin options
5. Configure ARIA attributes in Elementor (see usage instructions)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with other page builders besides Elementor? =

No, currently the plugin is specifically designed to work with Elementor.

= Is it compatible with the latest version of WPML? =

Yes, the plugin has been tested with version 4.7.3 of WPML Multilingual CMS and 3.3.2 of WPML String Translation.

= Why do I see the same string multiple times in WPML? =

This is by design. The plugin registers strings in multiple formats to ensure that they can be captured and translated regardless of how they are used in your Elementor content. You only need to translate each unique text once.

= Will this plugin slow down my website? =

The plugin includes several performance optimization options. By default, the most resource-intensive capture method (Full HTML Capture) only runs for admin users. You can adjust these settings in the plugin's configuration page.

= Can I use this plugin with Elementor Free? =

Yes, the plugin works with both Elementor Free and Elementor Pro.

= What should I do if translations aren't working correctly? =

Try using the "Force Refresh" button in the plugin settings. This will clear all caches and reinitialize the translation system. Also, make sure you have all three registration formats enabled for maximum compatibility.

= How do I know if the ARIA attributes are being translated correctly? =

You can verify this by:
1. Adding ARIA attributes in Elementor
2. Translating them in WPML String Translation
3. Switching to a different language on your frontend
4. Inspecting the element with browser developer tools to see if the translated text appears

= Does this work with Elementor global widgets and templates? =

Yes, the plugin works with all types of Elementor content, including global widgets, templates, and dynamic elements.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin configuration page with capture methods
2. Adding ARIA attributes in Elementor's Advanced tab
3. WPML String Translation interface showing ARIA strings
4. Example of translated ARIA attributes in different languages

== Usage Instructions ==

= How to add ARIA attributes in Elementor =

1. Edit any element in Elementor
2. Go to the "Advanced" tab
3. Find the "Custom Attributes" section
4. Add the ARIA attributes you want to translate

= Compatible formats =

Elementor indicates: "Set custom attributes for the wrapper element. Each attribute in a separate line. Separate attribute key from the value using `|` character."

You can add ARIA attributes in two ways:

**Basic format (one attribute per line):**
```
aria-label|Text to translate
```

**Multiline format (multiple attributes):**
```
aria-label|Text to translate
aria-description|Another description
```

This will generate the corresponding HTML attributes in the frontend:
`aria-label="Text to translate" aria-description="Another description"`

= How to translate the attributes =

1. Once you've added the attributes, save the page or template
2. Go to WPML → String Translation
3. Filter by one of the "AccessiTrans ARIA Attributes_XXX" contexts
4. Translate the strings as you would with any other text in WPML

= Best practices for optimal performance =

For the best experience and website performance, follow these recommendations:

1. **Enable all three registration formats** for maximum robustness:
   * Direct format
   * Prefix format
   * Element ID format

2. **Use the Force Refresh function** when translations aren't appearing as expected

3. **Only browse your site in the primary language** while generating strings for translation. This prevents the plugin from registering strings that may have already been translated through other systems.

4. **Disable capture methods after initial setup**:
   * Once you've captured all ARIA attributes for translation, we recommend disabling all capture methods in the plugin settings
   * This improves site performance and prevents additional strings from being registered in WPML
   * Re-enable the capture methods temporarily when you make changes to your site that include new ARIA attributes

= Practical examples =

**For a menu button:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Open menu`

**For a phone link:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Call customer service phone`

**For an icon without text:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Send an email`

**For a slider:**
* Attribute: `aria-label|Image gallery`
* Attribute: `aria-description|Navigate through product images`
